Take time series dataset and fields, then refill the missing date records and other fields.
}
\details{
Real time series sales dataset could be not continuous in 'date' field. e.g., monthly sales data is continuous,
 but discrete in daily data.

 This hollow dataset is not complete for time series analysis. Function dateRefill.fromFile
 is a transformation which tranforms uncomplete dataset into complete dataset.
